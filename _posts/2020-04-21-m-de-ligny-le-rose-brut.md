Appearance clear, deep salmon. On the nose, clean fairly pronounced red berries &amp; honey. On the palate quite tart, raspberry notes, little floral bit of citrusy lemon flavours too. Which leaves it really acidic, light bodied.  With a medium finish. I would say it is a good to very good wine. I would pair with a gooey chocolate brownie. Although also went really well with some aburi salmon.
