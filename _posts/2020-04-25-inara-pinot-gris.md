To start off we have wine from a local  winery to us, in the Yarra Valley, North Melbourne called Helen and Joey. They're a friendly group that want to be on first name basis with you. They even hand delivered the wine direct to us with free delivery! Particularly great in the current circumstances.
This wine is part of their Inara Collection meaning joyful/youthful. The collection focuses on everyday, every occasion, which definitely that is.

The appearance is clear and pale gold in colour. The smell is very pronounced, there is a little stone fruit as well as some pear maybe some slight grassy notes.

On the palate it is dry with high acidity with a medium body. And that pear taste really comes to its own. The quality is great, but personally I need a little less acidity which is why I rate it as 3.5 stars. But I think to food it will come into its own. They suggest Korean fried chicken which isn't my thing but I can see this going down well with a roast as that acidity would go through the salty roast potatoes really well.
