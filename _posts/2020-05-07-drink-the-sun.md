We had big expectations for this wine, as it is desribed as a wine that should emulate summer drinking, which is definitely our style. Safe to say this did not disappoint. The bottle itself is really well branded we felt like nothing was missed when creating this wine as it felt like every element was thought through.

The appearance is what we would describe as a medium salmon, and clear as it is unfiltered.

On the nose it is clean with a light intensity of red berries, in particular strawberries, with a hint of floral notes coming through which is very inviting. Upon tasting it the red berries are still prominent with a slight herbal finish. The wine is dry with a medium acidity and it is very light in body, but with it being quite alcoholic you might think otherwise. The finish itself is rather quick, arguably making it a good summer wine. The quality is very good all round.

Obviously, a good pairing for this is in the sun by the poolside but also we can see this pairing very well with light fish dishes and salads or even better a <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/superhealthy-salmon-salad" target="_blank" title="Pomegranate and Salmon Salad Recipe">pomegranate and salmon salad.</a>
