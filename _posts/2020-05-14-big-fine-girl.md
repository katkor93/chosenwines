Jeanneret winery started as a passion project between two friends who were able to acquire their vineyard in Clare Valley in 1992.

This particular wine is part of their Deco range, which explains the great design on the bottle, their Riesling currently the only white in the collection. The wines are inspired by Art Deco era, specifically Le Corbusier&rsquo;s publication “Decorative Art Today”. On their website they say that Art Deco is a combination of modernist styles, fine craftsmanship and rich materials which is also evdient in their wines.

Big Fine Girl is clear and has a pale gold colour.

On the nose it is very pronounced and aromatic, which is typical of the Riesling grape, we found it was very strong of citrus fruits, namely lemon and lemon peel. On the palate there was not much difference as it was very sharp with some grapefruit notes too. The iwine is dry, with high acidity with a light body. The quality was good.

This is not a wine we could not see ourselves drinking without food, and like with other acidic wine you would need to pair it with something salty and fatty. We tried it with halloumi and it was a treat but we can also see fish and chips being a really good option.

Jeanneret has given a lot of information about the wine on the label which we think is a really cool feature, this information which is also <a href="https://www.jeanneretwines.com/products/24527-jeanneret-big-fine-girl-riesling/" target="_blank" title="Jeanneret Wines">on their website</a>
