This is the first red wine we&rsquo;ve reviewed and also had in quite a while. And what a great wine to get you back to the dark side.

Two Pairs is owned by two women both named Katherine (great name!), well one is Kathryn, both go by their own nicknames.  They married identical twin brothers, hence the name Two Pairs. We think that is really sweet and to show that love their logo is all four of them. They only currently make three wines, Shiraz, Pinot Gris and Grenache.

The Grenache has a wonderful colour, very deep and clear ruby colour.

On the nose it is clean with red berry notes maybe a little minerality coming through but that could also be the alcohol. It is light in intensity but what is there is gorgeous.

The overall quality of the wine is very good. When tasting the wine there is the red berries there again, cherries, maybe a little raspberry with a slight herbeous finish. The wine has lovely soft tannis and low acidity but a light to medium body. The finish isn't particuarly long which does make it a great wine just to have on it&rsquo;s own, particuarly on a warm Autumn evening. But if you would want some food along side a cheese board would not go amiss here! This could also be a nice wine alongside a roast if you&rsquo;re looking for a red.
