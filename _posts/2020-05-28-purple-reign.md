As soon as we saw the advert for Purple Reign we knew we had to try it. With the wine being so purple in the photos we thought that there must be some editing going on. We were wrong. As soon as the wine arrived we realised that how it looks in the photos is actually how the wine looks. The colour comes from a natural antioxidant that was added to the wine to reduce the sulfites in it.

The colour is gorgeous and as there is no standarised way to describe we had a small discussion but we landed on lavender or a pale voilet. On the nose it is clean with a medium intensity. There is a strong presence of green bell pepper (capiscum), with a litttle lemon present too. But overall the wine has a lovely fresh quality to it.

On the palate the freshness and bell pepper is at the fore, again with a  small hint of lemon. It has a medium acidity which is great as the wine does not feel harsh and it has a light body giving it a great summery feel.

For us, the vegetal presence was a little too much to drink on it&rsquo;s own which is why we gave it three and a half. But you could definetely enjoy it in the sun with some chips and dip whilst catching up with friends - it does make a great talking point.

We would still recommend trying this as it&rsquo;s a super fun wine, they also do a sparkling wine and I think there might be more to come. Hopefully this isn&rsquo;t the last we see of Purple Reign.
