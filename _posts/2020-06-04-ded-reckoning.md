This is our first sparkling wine, and what a lovely start. Obelisk wines are made by Anna and Derek. Their winery is situated in South Australia and they aim to produce their wines in a sustainable way.

This wine is has a great golden colour, and the bubbles are nice and fine.

On the nose the wine is clean with a medium intensity of brown sugar, butter and a little vanilla - although no oak was used.

On the palate it is dry with low acidity and a nice light body. The slight disappointment is that there isn't as much flavour as you'd expect from such a wonderful smelling wine. This is why we have given it three stars as the taste doesn't hold up to some of the other wines we have. Arguably it makes it great for a celebration wine as it is easy to drink with a short finish.

If you're wondering when and where to have this wine we firmly feel that anytime you'd have Prosecco or Champagne this is a good option. Especially for Australians who want to support local. It is very affordable coming in under a regular Champagne price. It would be perfect to have as your guests arrive for a dinner party with some nibbles or as a wine with the dessert especially something like a custard tart.
