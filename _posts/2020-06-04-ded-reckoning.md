This is our first sparkling wine, and what a lovely start. Obelisk wines are made by Anna and Derek. Their winery is situated in South Australia and they aim to produce their wines in a sustainable way.

This wine is has a great golden colour, and the bubbles are nice and fine.

On the nose the wine is clean with a medium intensity of brown sugar, butter and a little vanilla - although no oak was used.

On the palate it is dry with low acidity and a nice light body. The slight disappointment is that there isn&rsquo;t as much flavour as you&rsquo;d expect from such a wonderful smelling wine. This is why we have given it three stars as the taste doesn&rsquo;t hold up to some of the other wines we have. Arguably it makes it great for a celebration wine as it is easy to drink with a short finish.

If you&rsquo;re wondering when and where to have this wine we firmly feel that anytime you&rsquo;d have Prosecco or Champagne this is a good option. Especially for Australians who want to support local. It is very affordable coming in under a regular Champagne price. It would be perfect to have as your guests arrive for a dinner party with some nibbles or as a wine with the dessert especially something like a custard tart.
