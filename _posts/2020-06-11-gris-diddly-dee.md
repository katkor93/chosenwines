Firstly, if you haven&rsquo;t already seen the video for this wine go and watch it. You&rsquo;ll definetely get our honest reactions.

Now you&rsquo;re back... we couldn&rsquo;t give a star rating for this wine as we weren&rsquo;t 100% sure if it was off or not as this is our first nautral unfiltered wine. If this is how it should taste it is definetely not to our liking.

Good Intentions Wine Co is a husband and wife duo, who create wine that reflects their personalities. They use organic methods hand picking the grapes, using indigenous yeast and adding minimal sulphur only when necessary. The label on the wine is great, all their labels and graphics are done by Tim Goschnick.

The appearance is wonderful a little hazy or cloudy due to it being unfiltered. The colour is a deep salmon or coral coloured if we&rsquo;re going off script.

On the nose it is very pronounced with an immediate sour smell. If you wanted to specify there is a little raspberry and maybe some grapefruit. The sour smell was so strong it started to become smokey. When writing the description after the video the smokey smell was even more intense.

On the palate it is dry, light bodied with high acidity and medium finish. The taste is really sour and tart, again it tasted a little smokey and spicy due to how sour it was. It was a little reminscent of sour beers or raspberry beers we've had. Overall the quality is very poor.

We couldn&rsquo;t give any food recommendations either as it is so bold and strong we couldn&rsquo;t think of anything that would hold up to it. But maybe you could cook with it?

We would still recommend checking them out and would always be open to trying some of <a href="https://www.goodintentionswine.co/" target="_blank" title="Good Intentions Wine">their other products.</a>
