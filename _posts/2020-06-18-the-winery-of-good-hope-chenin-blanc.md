The Winery of Good Hope is based in one of South Africa&rsquo;s main wine regions, Stellenbosch. With having stiff competition they wanted to really show off the region and the fruit grown there. Their aim is to produce wine that you can drink after a long day. As it is very affordable they also don&rsquo;t want to compromise on quality.

South Africa has a hot climate this could make the grapes ripen too quickly but with a cooling ocean breeze to moderate the climate this allows the grapes to ripen over time, providing more rounded fruity flavours. The Chenin Blanc grapes are picked at different levels of ripeness which allows the wine to develop a good acidity. Over the years their Chenin Blanc has picked up numerous awards, so we were definetely expecting big things

The colour is a lovely pale gold, nothing too out of the ordinary. On the nose, it is clean with a light aroma of stone fruits and. pear, there is a little minerality and freshness coming through as well as some citrussy notes. Which makes it a very pleasent smell.

The wine itself is dry, with a high acidity and medium body. The aromas that you smell also very much come through on the palate too. It is a very refreshing wine. The acidity is not overwhelming and almost adds a little spice to the flavour of the wine. The finish is short, but fades away really nicely which makes each sip very pleasent. Overall the quality is very good.

We certainly had no complaints drinking this wine - it is what you would easily describe as a crowd pleaser. We could easily drink this on it&rsquo;s own but can also see this going well with a roast chicken, like we&rsquo;ve said before high acidity wines can really go well with the salty and fatty roast potatoes. Alternatively, it would cut through a mild salsa very well, so if you were having tacos with grated cheddar on top the wine would compliment those flavours very well. Anything too spicy won&rsquo;t work as it would heighten the acidity making it too unpleasent to drink.
