Our second natural wine, after the first one it was safe to say we were a little aprehensive, but this wine really came through for us. 

Rosatea Field Blend comes from the winery and farm Valli Unite, started by three friends from farming backgrounds who all believed organic farming is the future. Their motto is care, for everything, you and your body, your surroundings and the people around you.  They wanted to go back to a more simplistic and modest way of living in the modern era and thus Valli Unite was formed. It is now a cooperative of around thirty people living and working on the farm. 

The colour of Rosatea Field Blend is a lovely deep coral which is bordering on an orangey red. It is slightly cloudy as it hasn&rsquo;t been filtered or fined but you can still see through it. 

On the nose it was very pronounced, again, there is a prominent smokey smell. Once you get past it there are red berries, a small amount of floral notes and a little under-ripe qualities like capsicum.

On the palate there isn&rsquo;t a huge difference from the nose. The first taste is quite smokey with hints of cranberry and other sharp berries. It almost tastes very alcoholic even though it is only at 12%.  The wine itself is very dry, it totally dries your mouth out. There is a medium acidity, low tannins and a light body.  The finish is fairly short. 

Comparing this to the Gris Diddly Dee, this was certainly more drinkable. This wine felt more intential in taste and is just fermented grape juice. It didn&rsquo;t feel like the wine had gone off. So this has definetely not deterred us from finding a natural wine that could be for us. Which is why we gave it three stars to this wine, it was drinkable but we wouldn&rsquo;t be rushing back to buy it soon.
