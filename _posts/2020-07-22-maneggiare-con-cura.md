We got this wine from a restaurant in Sydney, who were selling their wines during Lockdown. When searching the name nothing comes up about the winery or the wine so all we have to go on it is the label that the restaurant itself stuck on the back, which just has the country of origin, grape and number of serves. Maneggiare Con Cura translated from Italian means &ldquo;handle with care&rdquo;. We used this wine comparisons video on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chosenwines/" title="Chosen Wines Instagram"> our Instagram page</a> to compare it to the Old Vine Shiraz to show how Old Vines can really make a difference. 

The wine is a lovely deep rasberry or a ruby colour, it is clear. On the nose it smells quite sharp of red currants, raspberries and strawberries and it is not that pungent. 

On the palate it is very dry with medium tannis low acidity and a medium finish. Again there are red currants and raspbery notes which are quite sharp which would trick you into thinking that the wine is acidic. There is a vegetal quality to it too, almost mushroom-y which does end the wine on a slightly bitter note to it. It is a very light red which means it could be a great summer red if you are ever looking for one.  

As the wine is light in body but fruity it would lend itself more to light red meat dishes and earthy flavours as well as roasted vegetables. Personally, this wine isn't to our tastes but it is a good light red.
