The Mandoon Estate has quite a bit of history especially in comparison to other Australian wines we&rsquo;ve reviewed. There has been a winery and vineyard on the land since the mid 1800s. The people behind Mandoon Estate bought the land in 2008 and began trading in 2010. With this they bought some vines that were already on the property, which is where this particular Shiraz comes in. It uses grapes from a number of old vines (vines over the 25 years old) some of which date back to 1955. This can give the grapes more flavour as less grapes are produced on older vines. 

The colour of this wine is a really deep plum. It almost looks matte, which is strange to say about a wine but it doesn&rsquo;t have the same sheen to it that others do. On the nose it is very pronounced with rich jammy notes of cherries and plums, with a hint of warming spice. After we left this to air a little longer those spicier notes really came through.  
On the palate the jammy notes are not present like they are on the nose. Instead there are more red fruit notes like raspberry. In addition to this there are a little bit of vegetal notes and a little bit black pepper. It is a dry wine with low acidity, a medium body and fairly low in tannis. The finish is a good lenth and fades out quite nicely.

Overall it is a good wine it would have been great if what we smelt on the nose came through in taste but nonetheless it is still a good red. In terms of pairing being a strong red it would definetely stand against richer and heartier dishes as well as red meats. We think it could also go well with smoked dishes too.
