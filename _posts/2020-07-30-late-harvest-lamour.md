Late Harvest L&rsquo;amour is our first sweet and what a sweet wine to start with. Produced by Helen & Joey Estate who are based in the Yarra Valley. They have 3 different sweet wines in the Late Harvest collection. The collection has a lovely tagline attached to it which is &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry about being late, relax and enjoy. Let our wines be the start of something great&rdquo;. 

Late Harvest means the grapes are picked later than usual which means they slightly dry out on the vine leaving concentrated juice in the grape. 

The wine has a clear medium gold colour to it. On the nose it is clear and has very pronounced notes of peaches, golden pears, honey and a small amount of sweet pastry quality to it. 

On the palate these flavours really shine. It&rsquo;s almost like an alcoholic peach dipped in honey - delicious! It has a low acidity, full body and a long lasting finish. We really can&rsquo;t sing the praises of this wine enough it is just so tasty! 

In terms of food pairing you would need to either go with something as sweet as this wine so a fruit tart namely a peach tart. Alternatively, you could contrast the sweet with something strong in flavour and salty like a blue cheese. We also tried this with a twinky and it worked wonders - so that gives you an idea on how sweet it is. 

We can&rsquo;t recommend you try this more, head over <a href="https://https://helenandjoeyestate.com.au/shop/2015-late-harvest-chardonnay/" title="Helen & Joey Estate" target="_blank">to their website.</a> to see if you can get your hands on this beauty.
