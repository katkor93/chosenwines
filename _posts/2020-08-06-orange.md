Our first dip into the world of orange wine is Orange by Frankly, Bob Made This. Orange wine is when white grapes have had contact with the skin and maybe the seeds of the grapes for an extended period of time (from a few days up to a year) which gives the wine the colour. Only the Chardonnay and Riesling have had skin contact, although we&rsquo;re not sure how long. Nothing extra goes into Bob&rsquo;s wine so it really is just simply fermented grape juice.

The colour of the wine is lovely light amber, it is a little hazy as it isn&rsquo;t filtered or fined. 

On the nose it smells like beer, particuarly citrussy IPAs. There is a little hint of grapefruit and tropical fruit flavours. On the palate this doesn&rsquo;t change, it really is reminiscent of beer but it had a little more sour taste to it. It is very dry with a medium acidity, a light body and a fairly short finish. 

Overall this is probably the best natural wine we&rsquo;ve tried and definetely a good one to get started on if you&rsquo;re a beer drinker. At the time of writing it the winery&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.franklythiswinewasmadebybob.com.au/" title="Frankly This Wine Was Made by Bob" target="_blank"> website is still underconstruction</a> but you can learn more about the wine <a href="https://notwasted.io/collections/frankly-this-wine-was-made-by-bob/products/2019-frankly-this-wine-was-made-by-bob-orange" title="Not Wasted" target="_blank">from Not Wasted</a> where we bought the wine.
