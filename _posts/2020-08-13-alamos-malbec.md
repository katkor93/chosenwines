The Alamos winery is based at the foot of the Andes mountains, giving it a very interesting terroir. Terroir is the how the climate, soil and terrain effect the taste of the grapes and therefore the wine. Where Alamos&rsquo; winery is there is clean air, intense sunlight, frosty cold nights and mineral-rich Andes snowmelt to provide water to the vines. This Malbec is there flagship wine, and has won them multiple awards. Sometimes, to really enhance the red fruit notes, they blend small amounts of other wine, although we&rsquo;re not sure if this happened on this particular year. 

The wine is a gorgeous deep ruby colour. On the rose it is very pronounced with notes of vanilla, plus red cherry & black cherry. 

On the palate there are medium tannis with a medium body and low acidity. It is incredibly rich with medium dry finish, strong berry notes & a hint of vanilla. It is what you&rsquo;d expect out of a good Argentinian Malbec. 

It&rsquo;s hard for us to pair this as the things we don&rsquo;t eat are probably what would go best but we think red meats and hearty dishes are certainly a good option. 

It is a fantastic red and we&rsquo;d highly recommend giving it a go if you can get your hands on it. To get more information about this wine and the others they produce <a href="http://www.alamoswinesus.com/" title="Alamos Winery" target="_blank">go to their website.</a>
