During the video for this wine we really struggled to get flavour out of it. Luckilly we write the reviews the next day which allows the wines develop flavours. This really devloped over night and showed us what it&rsquo;s made of! 

Pure Vision has a really lovely origin story, you can read it <a href="https://www.purevisionwines.com.au/" title="Pure Vision Wines" target="_blank">on their website</a>. They are fully organic, so no pesticides or chemicals are used in the farming of their grapes. 

The wine itself is very deep in colour, it almost looks like apple juice or honey it is such a deep gold colour. 

On the nose it almost smells sweet like honey or syrup. It also smells like gold apples and pears with a small amount of golden kiwi fruit. 

On the palate theres not much difference to the smell. There is very prominent apple taste, it almost has a cider quality to it. The wine is medium in body and in acidity, but it is nicely rounded by the flavours of the wine. It does taste quite alcoholic, as it is 13.5%. 

With such a unique taste it is hard to come up with the perfect food pairing for it. As it has such a strong apple taste perhaps pork would be a good option. As it is quite sweet it could work with some medium spiced curries but nothing with coconut milk or cream in it as it probably won&rsquo;t pair up well with the creamy-ness. 

This is a really lovely white wine with a surprising taste and we would definetely recommend. We also had the 2018 vintage of this wine so we did a comparision video on our Instagram page as well as a full review on the blog.
