Whilst we didn&rsquo;t do a full review we did do a quick comparison video of both this vintage and the 2017 on our Instagram page. This wine is produced by South Australia&rsquo;s Pure Vision, it has a really sweet origin story, you can read it <a href="https://www.purevisionwines.com.au/" target="_blank" title="Pure Vision Wines">on their website</a>. They are fully organic, so no pesticides or chemicals are used in the farming of their grapes. 

The wine has a very pale gold to it, with a slight greenish hue.

It is not very intense in aromas but what you do get is very pleasent. It smells very crisp and fresh, there is a little citrusy notes, maybe a tiny amount of apple and grass. There is a fair amount of minerality as there is a bit of metalic smell to it too. 

Like its 2017 counterpart what you smell is also what you taste, it is very crisp with citrusy notes very present. There is a fair amount of minerality too. It is light in body, high in acidity with a fairly short finish. 

This almost feels like a French Sauvignon Blanc, so would pair nicely with delicate white fish pesto pasta. It&rsquo;s a fairly inoffensive so could go with a lot of dishes quite easily.
