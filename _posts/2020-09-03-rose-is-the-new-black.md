This wine is the answer to the question what would happen if an incredibly popular Wine Subscription Service teamed up with an award winning winery? We&rsquo;ve mentioned Good Pair Days a number of times on this blog, we use them for a number of the wines we use on the show. Heddonist Wines is a father, daught & husband trio who make award winning wines (especially their rosés) in South Australia. They have a minimalistic approach to wine making. 

The wine is a really nice pastel salmon-orange colour. On the nose it isn&rsquo;t that pronounced but there are some notes of berries a little bit of melon and some minerality too. 

On the palate it is a completely different story, the taste really hits your tongue. The wine has a sweet taste to it, similar to fairy floss. There are lots of strawberry and cherry notes too with a little hint of peppery spice in the background. There is a medium acidity but you barely notice it as the sweet fruity notes on your palate take away that sensation. It has a medium body and medium finish too. 

This is an incredible rosé, we were a little apprehensive as this was a bottle we got for free with Good Pair Days but it really blew us away. As it has a sweetness to it, it could certainly hold itself up against a bit of spice or you could have savoury dishes that have an element of sweet to them such as pizza which has the sweetness from the tomato sauce. In all honesty, it is so delicious you probably would just want to drink it on its own.  


Like we have said, we got this from Good Pair Days but we&rsquo;re not sure if you can buy it from the directly as we got it for free. We&rsquo;ve recommended them before but if you want to try them they tailor wine to your tastes through a really in depth quiz (not sponsored!) but if you&rsquo;re interested, we have a <a href="https://www.goodpairdays.com/invite/PIE123918" title="Referal link for Good Pair Days" target="_blank">referal link</a> which will get you a $38 bottle of wine in your first box!

We would also recommend checking out <a href="https://www.hedonistwines.com.au/" title="Hedonist Wines" target="_blank">Hedonist Wines</a> to try their rosés.
